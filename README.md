# SystemFetch
Another neofetch-like utility but this time it's fast.

# Example
  ![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Y5U/SystemFetch/main/example.png)
  
# Compile
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Y5U/SystemFetch.git
$ make
# make install
$ sf
```

# Compatibility
This is probably not very portable, though I am trying to make it. If you want to help, test it on your BSD or Linux distrobution and report any errors or issues.
